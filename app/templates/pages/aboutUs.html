                    <p>Romaine Calm was started by a software Developer who loves to cook. Linh was standing in a
                        grocery store in 2022, wishing she could look up her family recipes, as well as a vast cookbook of
                        options to make the most of what was freshest that day. We are a welcoming home cook community
                        that shares the same passion for being in the kitchen as you do.</p>
                    <p>With Romaine Calm, you can take your recipes anywhere, make grocery lists, reduce food waste and
                        easily share your favorite creations with your friends, family or even your future self when you
                        need them. </p>
                    <p>Our Romaine Calm platform enables new recipe, shopping and nutrition applications with our API,
                        connecting home cooks with the foods they love, allowing developers, bloggers and webmasters to
